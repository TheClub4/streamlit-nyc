The dashboard, amongst other features, showcases a plotly histogram for the breakdown of motor vehicle collisions by minute between one-hour intervals.

It also has an interactive 3D map that displays the frequency of collisions during a given time of day; notice that most motor vehicle collisions happen at night. The map was plotted by utilising Uber's open source deck.gl library (pydeck).
